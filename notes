Positioning
position:relative means 'activate top, left'. You can then move it relative to where it would have been in layout already
position:absolute means 'don't give me space in layout'.
top and left, if set, are relative to the window or the first parent that's also relative or absolute
If all children of an are absolute, then element now has no height.

Size Constraints
Seems to work as expected by default, including width, height.
Width, height are always size of content area. outerWidth(true) is everything, with margin

Overflow
Doesn't work. Part of layout, and we've turned it off with absolute. 
My panel's overflow property is now useless

clipping -- for the elment that's absolutely positioned
apply clip to child if necessary. clip is relative to child's space.
$child.css('clip', 'rect(0px,60px,200px,0px)');


Width in CSS:
Block-level elements take up full width of their parent. Height is height of children.


Alternative
Just set proper css classes. 
Can this all be done in CSS with no JS? What's the benefit then?
Can also set top and left properties instead of css transform


- How to be notified for all cases where layout might change? 
  - resize of container, added / removed elements
  - DOMSubtreeModified
  - onresize event


Eventually look into how to make responsive stuff better.



Some nice layout things to consider
- way to say 'fill remainder' for width or height
